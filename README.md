AI-Powered Retail Inventory Optimization & Financial Risk Mitigation

Project Overview

This Capstone Project, developed for the Microsoft Elevate Azure Internship, addresses the financial challenges of modern retail management. By utilizing Azure Machine Learning and time-series forecasting, the system minimizes capital loss and ensures liquidity.

Problem Statement

Retailers face significant financial risks due to "Capital Lock-in" in unsold inventory (Dead Stock) and revenue loss from "Stock-outs." This project provides a data-driven approach to stabilize the supply chain and optimize cash flow.

Proposed Solution

The system implements a cloud-native intelligence layer on Microsoft Azure:

Demand Intelligence: Utilizing the Prophet Algorithm to predict hourly and seasonal demand with high accuracy.

Financial Risk Scoring: A custom logic that identifies high-value items at risk of becoming dead stock.

Automated Procurement: Streamlining the re-order process to maintain a healthy Inventory Turnover Ratio.

Tech Stack

Cloud Platform: Microsoft Azure

Data Analytics: Azure Synapse & Data Factory

AI/ML: Azure Machine Learning Studio, Prophet Algorithm

Visualization: Power BI Dashboards

How to Run

Ensure you have Python installed.

Install dependencies: pip install pandas prophet matplotlib

Run the script: python main.py
